# Same structural pattern as SW1: pole (pin 3) is a FIXED rail, the two
# throws are the signals it gets connected to -- not the other way around
# (an earlier version had the pole carrying the signal and one throw tied
# to GND, which collapsed to on-off-off: that throw was electrically
# indistinguishable from center's own pulldown-default-low state whenever
# GPIO wasn't actively fighting it). Now genuinely ON-OFF-ON:
#   throw1 -> EN_SW_BMC : force the BMC branch (U4) on
#   center               : neither forced, GPIO (through its own series
#                           resistor on the power sheet) has full control,
#                           defaults off via pulldown -- same safe idle
#                           state as before
#   throw4 -> EN_SW_ALT : force the ALT branch (U14) on
# Pole sourced from +5V_ALT rather than +3V3_ALWAYS so the ALT-forcing
# throw -- the one that matters most, since it's the only one useful when
# the BMC's own USB-C is unpowered -- works without needing J9 plugged in.
# Trade-off: the BMC-forcing throw is a no-op unless an alt source is also
# present to supply the pole. Accepted -- if BMC power is the only source
# present, forcing it onto +5V_SW is only ever wanted with firmware
# running anyway (you're already talking to the ESP32 to know to do it),
# so it's not a hardware-only scenario the way the ALT case is.
#
# Pole (pin 3) ties straight to +5V_ALT -- no gating jumper. The digipot
# first-power-up overvoltage risk this used to guard against (JP1 + a
# mandatory bring-up checklist, see git history) is now handled by the
# VCORE/VDDR voltage-select jumpers on the power sheet instead: with FB
# routed to a fixed preset divider rather than the digipot, VCORE/VDDR are
# hardware-deterministic regardless of what SW2 does or what's in the
# digipot's NV memory. The user sets those jumpers by hand for whichever
# interposer is seated -- that manual step is what makes it safe to remove
# this gate.
