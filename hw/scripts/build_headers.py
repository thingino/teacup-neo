"""Pin-breakout header sheet -- carrier-side labeled 0.1in headers for the
per-SoC GPIO/peripheral superset assigned to J1 pins 87-96 (unit 2 tail) and
97-192 (units 3-4) in build_connector.py. Same system as the approved power/
connector/bmc/io sheets: no wires, global labels matching the connector's
net names carry connectivity across sheets, 50mil grid throughout.

Clustering is a silkscreen/likely-use convenience only (per explicit user
direction) -- these are plain 0.1" pin headers, not a protocol-specific
connector, so a user is free to wire them however they want regardless of
which cluster a signal was grouped into. Each header gets one GND pin (pin 1,
top) for a local scope-ground reference; the header's own net names are
carried in the label text next to each pin, not just the multi-function
silkscreen legend, so both the schematic and the fab silkscreen agree.
